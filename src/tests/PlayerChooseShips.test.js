const playerChooseShips=require('../PlayerChooseShips');
let playerBoard=[];
let GameBoard=[];


    // test('player choosing his ships(playerBoard, gameBoard returns)',()=>{
    //     expect(playerChooseShips([[1,1],[2,2],[4,5],[4,6],[6,6],[6,5],[3,3],[5,3],[1,2],[1,5],[3,6],[3,2]],GameBoard,playerBoard)).toEqual('whatever');
    // })



    // WORKS(wont work if i run it now - in a real scenario playerChooseShips wont accept an array of all coordinates, only 1 tile coordinates, so i had to mimic it inside the function, which i deleted after testing it)
